# CraftingSystemDemo

This was made during a series of in-class assignments in C# programming 2.
It is a console application that can craft items from recipes primarily.

It was continued in my later project [Crafting WPF](https://github.com/lanedhoward/CraftingWPF) with more functionality and a graphical interface.
